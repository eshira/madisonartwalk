  "body": "### An art walk for everyone.\r\nMadison is home to many artists and studios. Visit them on a walking tour of the isthmus on a weekend in the spring (to be determined).\r\n\r\n### A free, community building event\r\nParticipate on your own terms. No registration fees. This is a community run event.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nMany art fairs and similar events nickel and dime the artists (inflated registration fees for subpar services). We take pride in the Madison community and believe that together we can host a free art walk, without registration fees. The goal of the art walk is not to make a few bucks. The goal of the art walk is to organize a community building event.",
